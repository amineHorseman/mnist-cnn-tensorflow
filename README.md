Implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks on MNIST dataset with Tensorflow - Detailed Steps
## A simple deep convolutional neural network to classify MNIST dataset using Tensorflow
- To fully grasp the implementation of CNNs in tensorflow, we'll learn by classifying the simple MNIST dataset with 10 output classes. The basic idea of CNNs are the same even when we scale this up to the CIFAR-10 dataset.
